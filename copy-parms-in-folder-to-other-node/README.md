# copy-parms-in-folder-to-other-node
A script to copy all parms in source parm folder from source node to the destination node.

## How To Use:
To run, go to the Houdini shelf and right click -> New Tool, go to the Script tab, paste the script
into the editor, scroll down to the bottom (line 103), fill in the correct input parameters, hit
accept, and press the new button in the shelf.

It is recommended to run this script from a Shelf Tool instead of the Python shell so that the
actions taken by the script can be undone/redone with ctrl+z.
