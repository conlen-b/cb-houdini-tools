# **[Copy Parms to Other Node](./CopyParmsToOtherNode.py)**
A script to copy a parm or all parms in source parm folder from source node to the destination node.

## How To Use:
To run, go to the Houdini shelf and right click -> New Tool, go to the Script tab, paste the script into the editor, scroll down to the bottom (line 147), fill in the correct input parameters, hit accept, and press the new button in the shelf.

It is recommended to run this script from a Shelf Tool instead of the Python shell so that the actions taken by the script can be undone/redone with ctrl+z.
